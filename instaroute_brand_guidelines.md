## About InstaRoute

InstaRoute was developed to provide a flexible and well thought out dispatch platform for fast paced transportation providers.

### Mission
Simplifying Dispatch Workflow through intelligent automations

## Design Guidelines

These guidelines describe the visual and verbal elements that represent InstaRoute's corporate identity. This includes our name, logo and other elements such as color, type and graphics.

Sending a consistent and controlled message of who we are is essential to presenting a strong, unified image of our company. These guidelines reflect InstaRoute's commitment to quality, consistency and style.

The InstaRoute brand, including the logo, name, colors and identifying elements, are valuable company assets.

Each of us is responsible for protecting the company's interests by preventing unauthorized or incorrect use of the InstaRoute name and marks.

## The Corporate Logo and Typography

### The Full Logo Type

The InstaRoute corporate logo comprises of two elements; the logo symbol and logotype.

#### 1) The Logo Symbol
In the logo, the icon is made of navigation symbol, since InstaRoute is dispatch software. Which makes the icon unique and easily recognizable.

#### 2) The Logo Title
Carefully chosen for its modern yet refined and highly legible style, the font used for "InstaRoute" is **Gotham Rounded (Medium and Book)**.

### Important Notice
**Attention:** Use of any stylized, animated, hand drawn or other versions of an unofficial logo is not permitted, as this undermines the logo system and brand consistency. Please consult with InstaRoute Trademark Licensing if you have any questions or need further help.

## Exclusion Zone

It is important to keep corporate marks clear of any other graphical element. To regulate this, an exclusion zone has been established around the corporate mark. 

The logo and icon's exclusion zone is equal to **half the height of the icon**. This exclusion zone indicates the closest any other graphic element or message can be positioned in relation to the mark of the symbol itself and our company name – they have a fixed relationship that should never be changed in any way.

## Logo On Application

These are the preferred settings for using the logo on dark or colored backgrounds.

## Single Color

If printing in full color is not available, the option of single color printing is recommended for InstaRoute logo. White color also can be used on dark or colored background.
